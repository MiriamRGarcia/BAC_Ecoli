AMIGO IN MATLAB HELP
=====================

The published HTML documentation of AMIGO can be easily organised in a way that
the HTMLs appear in the MATLAB Help in a structured form.

This let the user navigate easily in the documentation. Further, the documentation is searchable.

***********
(I) FILES
***********

There are two types of files: (1) static files, that describes the structure of the HELP and the connection of the HTMLs. And
(2) the files that describes the functions in AMIGO, tutorials and case studies, which are generated by the publish command (these make up content of the help). 

Files in (1) shall be generated manually:
 - Help\info.xml    -  required file that is recognised by matlab. It defines the entry of AMIGO in the matlab help and points to the Help\html folder. Does NOT need regular updated. 
 - Help\htmls\static   - files the content of which do not really change (or publish cannot make it, eg 2 column): contact details, getting started page, product overview. Does NOT need regular updated. 
 - \Help\htmls\helptoc.xml    - defines the structure of the documentation. Shall be updated if we need to insert a new entry  in the help. Uses <tocitem> </tocitem> tags to insert an element. 

Files in (2) are automatically generated by Help\generate_documentation\gen_amigo_doc.m
- based on publishing MATLAB codes ( for the list check gen_amigo_doc.m, typically publish the doc_AMIGO_*.m files. )

(II) Add new material (tutorial, case study, manual etc.)
***********************************************************

1. create the new material as publishable MATLAB .m file in the Help\generate_documentation\  folder.
	-If possible, use the doc_AMIGO_FILENAME naming convention.) 
	- You can use other doc_AMIGO* as template (for example to appear the AMIGO logo in the top of the html file,
		or to use section labels, that can be used as references in the helptoc.xml).
2. publish the code using the "publish" command and copy all the files created in the Help\generate_documentation\html  to the Help\htmls. (htmls and image files)
3. update the \Help\htmls\helptoc.xml  by inserting  <tocitem target="doc_AMIGO_FILENAME.html"> NAME_IN_AMIGO_HELP </tocitem>. 
4. include the file in amigo_gen_doc.m (just extend the list), so that it will be automatically published and copied in the right folder. 
5. Commit the new and updated files to the SVN (your original doc_AMIGO_FILENAME.m file and other neccessary files to publish, the updated amigo_gen_doc.m, the helptoc.xml and also the doc_AMIGO_FILENAME.html and related image (.png) files.)

 
***********************************************************
Make the contribution searchable:
the following code (amigo_gen_doc.m runs it automatically) creates a search database.
 >> AMIGO_path
 >> builddocsearchdb([amigodir.path,filesep,'Help',filesep,'htmls'])
 
The known problem is that the "builddocsearchdb" shall be called in each MALTAB version to produce compatible database with that matlab version.
